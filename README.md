Build command (macos): cmake ../.. && make
>To build:
>- Make a build directory in nogit.
>- Compile SDL3 and freetype yourself.
>- Have the SDL3 and freetype dylibs in RePiskel/../Cached (it's shorter than it was before).
>- Have the SDL3 headers located in /opt/homebrew/include (I wish homebrew allowed you to install sdl3).
>- Have the freetype headers located in /usr/local/include/freetype2.
