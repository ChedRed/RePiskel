Build command: cmake ../.. && make
>To build (macos):
>- Make a build directory in nogit.
>- Compile SDL3 and SDL3_ttf yourself.
>- Have the SDL3 and SDL3_ttf dylibs in RePiskel/../Cached (it's shorter than it was before).
>- Have the SDL3 and SDL3_ttf headers located in /opt/homebrew/include (I wish homebrew allowed you to install sdl3).
